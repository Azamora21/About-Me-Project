          <h2>Early life</h2>
          <p>As I was growing up I enjoyed many pleasures that children would enjoy. But Partying was easily one of them.</p> 
		  <p>I would go and endulge myself with the simple pleasures of partying. As seen in the image below I was quite the pary animal.</p>
		  <p>Even though I clearly lived the life of a Roman Emperor, I still had to attend classes. Partying, although fun, is not a way to attain knowledge and wisdom.</p>
		  <p>I attened school at various places but the one place where I settled was <a href="https://www.alsd.k12.ca.us/stork"> Stork Elementary.</a></p>
