        <h2>Dreams</h2>
        <p>I had many dreams of the future when I was a little boy but the most prominent, was the dream of becoming a doctor.</p>
		<p>This drive to become a doctor had long been present but only then around the age of nine, I wanted to save people</p>
		<p>Maybe it was the prevalence of doctors in people lives and the amount of money but for some reason I was drawn to the idea of being a docotor.</p>
		<p>This would all change when the famous show came out, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Spacetime_Odyssey"> Cosmos: A spacetime Odyssey.</a></p>

          <h2>Aspirations</h2>
          <p>The main difference between aspirations and dreams are the reality concerning them both.</p> 
		  <p>Dreams are simply someones view of what their role would be in a "perfect world."</p>
		  <p>On the other hand someones aspirations are the tangible hope and ambition that they display to achieve their desired goal.</p>
		  <p>So with that defined I have perfect world dreams but my aspirations are sperate than them. I aspire to become a scientist, to be more specific, an astrophyiscist.</p>

			<h2>Gained Aspiration</h2>
			<p>My love for the celestial bodies above us right now didnt come out of the blue but was found in the little moments.</p>
			<p>What sparked my love for the stars began on night on a cruise ship. My family was out on the balcony lookink at the ocean and listening to the calm waters.</p>
			<p>I instead was captivated from what I saw in the water. What seemed to be counteless of twinkling spots on the water entranced me.</p>
			<p>I looked up from the waters to see vast stretches of stars coating the skies, ever since i have done nothing but try and further my knmowledge of the heavens above us.</p>
