        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Some of my hobbies are looking at the planets with my telescope.</p>
		<p>I also like to bake because one day my mom stopped making cake, cookies, etc. because I had gotten a few cavaties and a few pounds.</p>

          <p>When I come home after school I usually enjoy eating my moms Peruvian Cuisene and relaxing.</p>
		  <p>What happens quite often is me sleeping for 2-3 hours, most of my days are just me crashing on the bed and staying up late.</p>
